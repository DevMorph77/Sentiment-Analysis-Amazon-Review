4.0,Simple and beautiful,I love this clear case for my Not Pink Pixel It showcases my phone instead of covering it up The dot grid is very effective and I like that the grid extends unto the sides of the case I can see why some people have commented on the precision of the cut outs and buttons My side buttons are aligned just not perfectly it doesn t bother me or affect my use of the power or volume buttons and I don t spend my time staring at the side of my phone I tend to look at the screen most often The cutouts for the back camera and the fingerprint are perfect My only complaint is that the material of the case has a tendency to pick up body oils it doesn t look bad it just feels icky so I clean the case more often than others cases I ve had for phones in the past However is that such a bad thing Phones are filthy and germ ridden so I don t mind feeling the need to clean it more often The case does have a small lip that will protect the phone if it falls unto a flat surface I had no problem using this case with a screen protector on Overall it s a great case lightweight thin and aesthetically pleasing If you want to show off your pixel in it s natural glory then get this case,B07H822S39,B07H822S39,AGE7PTHXFLTIZJNMSGVDDKB4UTKQ,1542735448406,4,True,0.0232,0.1203,0.8565

3.0,Nice concept but hard to place,I felts that this was a great concept However in practice this phone holder does not work as well as I thought it would Mounting is fine although the adhesive is strong enough to make removing it a pain However positioning the ball takes some forethought and cannot be used on all cars Ideally the mounts should be placed on a vertical surface on the dashboard This should allow for the greatest amounts of viewing angle possible On top of a dashboard surface does not allow the phone to rotate to a comfortable viewing angle This was unfortunate because my car does not have a good vertical surface for the amounts to be placed on Also having a magnet on the back of my phone was not s an ideal situation It makes it a hassle to put in and out of a pocketand also I fear that I will accidentally put the phone near my wallet which will erase my credit cards As a results I decided to go with a different mounts that simply has a metal plate to go on the phone case and a magnet that is only on the mounting arm I would have liked for this mount to work for its looks alone but unfortunately it did not for me,B00BAQKRHY,B0B6JW3P9J,AFTZ6YGG6HEANT2F7QLJS72M2WFQ,1413097429000,3,True,0.6261,0.3176,0.0563

2.0,Not Recommended,Quality br Value br br I originally purchased this case as a substitute for the much more expensive Apple version The case itself has a nice texture and is smooth and tactile without being tacky It is very clear but does scratch relatively easily Two major issues that I noticed br The case at first did not fit the phone correctly When I would grip my phone at the sides there would be a noticeable squeaking sound as if there was a misfit between the phone and the case After about weeks of use this went away and it seems to fit well however it was very annoying and did not really make sense why it just did not fit br The bottom most magnet just fell out I m not sure if it is because the magnets are just too strong but with magnets being the main thing you are looking at and the main selling point of the case it is not a great feeling to have one fall out br If you are really into the clear look without MagSafe get a normal clear case If you want a clear case with MagSafe I unfortunately would point you in the Apple direction,B096HHWGW9,B096HJ83VK,AE62EFV3B6RLVWOQ7Y6IPI7BKJSQ,1640662880968,0,True,0.1448,0.4696,0.3856

5.0,Easy Installation,I bought this because of the guarantee and the quality stated in the description I just installed the glass on my iphone this morning The instructions were clear and the glass went on easily I obviously have not had the product on the phone long enough to test its durability and would like the opportunity to rate again in a couple of months or longer I hope My expectation is that the glass does not chip or crack like some competitors do I also like the personalized follow up via email to check on my satisfaction with the product That s good customer service One suggestion is that there be instructions to reload the tray I have a second screen in the package The foolproof tray approach eliminates touching adhesive on the screen and the need for fussy line up of glass when applying to phone It s not hard to figure out but might as well reuse the alignment tray again and again and not waste the plastic Kudos to the engineering team For easy application be sure to remove any protective sleeve on your iphone so that it sits nicely in the loading tray,B01ARX59EG,B0C53WTS7L,AHQHTODFDDYUDAHOJVTLQTQXLZPQ,1548690698511,0,True,0.0125,0.1601,0.8274

5.0,Tempered Glass Privacy Screen - Works Great,Most people think of screen protection for a mobile phone as a glass or plastic cover that prevents the actual screen from shattering That s true this is the most important aspect of screen protection But what about protecting the data displayed on the screen I have seen privacy screens for laptop screens but this is the first I have used with a mobile phone and it works exactly like the laptop screen protectors br br Similar to a regular screen protector this is a thin sheet of glass that applies very smoothly and easily with no bubbles It has fine screen coverage to the edge of the phone this has been an issue on some other screen protectors I have used but not this one br br With this screen protector in place the screen is definitely darker than usual and it might be helpful to adjust the screen brightness It is a lot like looking at your screen through a pair of sunglasses Turning the phone at a degree angle makes the screen appear completely black as if the screen has been turned off no light can be seen at all br br Before I put this protector on the phone I held it up to a light source and saw a repeating pattern of the light source itself almost like I had held up a mirror to a mirror to get a replicated image I think this protector works via polarized light and the repeating image is an effect of that I have seen similar phenomena when wearing polarizing sunglasses br br If protecting the data on your phone screen is as important to you as protecting the screen itself this is the screen protector you need It works great is easy to apply and is sufficient protection for you phone s screen to prevent physical damage Just make sure you have the right one for your model of phone br br Disclaimer I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair honest and thorough review Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias based solely on my experience with it,B00T93ZJUU,B00T93ZJUU,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,1429234942000,0,True,0.0728,0.6087,0.3185

4.0,Remarkable.,This is a pretty remarkable phone It has an impressive display looks great and does not exhibit any signs of slowdown or lagging that some other reviewers have noted worth noting that I m not a power user I expect all operating systems and especially open source types such as Android to decline in functionality over time and I think the best thing to do is simply save what you really need reload the software and start fresh with what should then feel like a brand new phone br br The appearance is what makes this phone remarkable While I don t think it looks particularly expensive I do appreciate its simple monolithic type design its thinness without threatening to bend and I love that it comes with a screen protector and case The case is simple and form fitting and keeps the phone from jumping out of your hand like a bar of soap Careful with that screen protector it s the type that can come off when you try to remove the top layer I wasted mine br br I think the size is great Any bigger is creeping into not fitting into some jeans pockets comfortably territory br br About this monolithic design looks cool but the drawback is not ever being able to replace the battery and lack of SD card support which are two of the biggest weaknesses I associate with Apple phones The other weakness here is trying to look like an Apple phone while I d rather have this phone any day trying to copy something else makes you seem cheap and without confidence That sort of shows in the name too But hey they know their market br br Missing the SD card slot is a big deal for me but may not be a deal killer for others I like to keep a GB card in my phone full of my favorite music I don t like streaming anyway but streaming isn t always available even if you do like it like driving at top speed through the Arabian desert or even just sitting on a plane so having a fairly robust collection of tunes on hand is something I don t feel is worth going without Of course for just programs I ve never needed more than internal memory on a phone worth noting is that newer games take up a lot of space especially the free ones with video ads of course you can always delete those once they have been played br br Conclusion is that this phone provides great bang for the buck I actually love it for my second phone my quick grab tablet something to let the kids play on for short periods of time and even a primary phone IF the missing SD card slot doesn t bother you,B00S5C3BCY,B00S82OKNU,AGRPLHGW2CR6WWOHT5TOWXDGIZEQ,1423521283000,2,False,0.0276,0.1087,0.8637

3.0,Careful if you have a big phone..Great for smaller phones.,This is a wonderfully compact selfie stick tripod mount I ordered this for the tripod more than the selfie part I never take selfies But I think it would work really well for that It s simple to charge and actually pretty nice I really love how everything fits together so tightly There is a lock to hold the tripod legs in place when opened I would only use the tripod indoors though because my phone is about the same weight as this making it a falling over hazard in wind The telescoping part fits very tightly I was worried about catching skin on the final part of closing the telescoping pol because it took a LOT of pressure However it did work and no skin damaged br br I couldn t figure out how to remove the remote control which is also so nicely fitted into the small device but when I watched the video in the description it was clear You press the button of the remote with your thumb while moving in an upward motion and it comes off very easily br br My only regret is that it won t fit my iPhone if it s in its case so I will only use this at home for photos and videos probably of Amazon vine items br br When I read the following description Compatible with iPhone Pro Xs max XS XR X Galaxy S Small Camera I should have been more careful I have an iPhone Pro Max but it doesn t actually say it will fit In fact because the description has no comma s I don t feel entirely bad So it should fit an iPhone Pro an iPhone XS Max etc My phone s width is so it fits in the phone mount but it doesn t fit when in it s case yes the dimensions are actually in the description fits if I had only scrutinized the product image gallery Ideally I would like something where I wouldn t have to take my phone out of its case to use Also it was difficult to get it back out of the BGJOY holder I gave it stars because if my phone were a bit smaller I would absolutely love it br br Edit well it s been about a week and I have been using another tripod but have used this one with an older smaller phone I have to say it s a bit too light and I feel harm could come to my phone It is so easy to knock over by accidentally brushing it I am removing a star,B07YWXB5T3,B07YWXB5T3,AEGERLR2HVVRY3J75OX4C3DVCAOA,1596983500100,0,False,0.0247,0.0962,0.8791

3.0,"Good, not perfect",Received this today The case is reasonably thin but there are thinner out there The cutouts all line up as they should But the cutout come with covers which is a nice idea but the covers make putting the outer plastic case on all that more difficult It takes a little time and manipulation to get the plastic case situated just so so that those covers will open and close properly when you need them to The back of the case looks very nice but is a bit slippery The volume control and the power switch are covered by the rubber interior portion of the case with the rubber raised for easier access The volume control does not work as smoothly as it should You have to press down harder then should be necessary to get it to work Power button seems okay This is an Otterbox and I expect it to be top notch but it s not It s good but it just seems that otterbox could have put a little more effort into it to get it right like it s expected to be Case is pretty light so it doesn t seem to ad extra weight It appears that it will do a good job protecting the phone and that s what its all about It also looks pretty nice especially the back of the case Time will tell how well it holds up br,B0081ZXKUS,B0081ZXKUS,AFXB7QTJFC7XZJBKG4RIF43MVLXA,1348690542000,1,True,0.4344,0.4901,0.0756

4.0,"Pretty! Hard Work Resizing, But Worth It",Overall now that I have it sized this is a very nice band for my Fitbit Alta HR I ve only been wearing it a day so I can t say much about its long term durability So far though it seems fairly well made br br The down side is that if you have small to average female wrists you are probably going to have to resize this band and it s no easy task There were no instructions with it and I mean at all Zero Zip That said it s fairly intuitive at least for removing the pins I wasn t sure how to get the pins back in so I asked a question on the product page and other users said it was the same process in reverse Sounds simple but it was much trickier since you have to match up the holes on the links exactly right and then push in the teeny tiny pin before using the tool to complete the process but eventually I did get it to work Also note that the pins have a narrow end and a wider end You need to make sure the narrow end goes in first when putting the pins back in Also you might want to use needlenose pliers I got a small metal splinter doing this I ended up removing two links I could probably remove one more but I think at that point the band would be too tight br br The Fitbit is heavier than the band so it does slide a little side to side If you make it tight enough this probably won t be an issue But I m pleasantly surprised at how light the whole thing feels I had gotten used to my prior bands and they were plenty comfortable but this one is thin and light and even more comfortable than the original strap,B077SZDKG9,B077SZDKG9,AEEV4GBNUENV4IFDWWQGLOTBZMGQ,1544109691943,0,True,0.0342,0.1714,0.7944
