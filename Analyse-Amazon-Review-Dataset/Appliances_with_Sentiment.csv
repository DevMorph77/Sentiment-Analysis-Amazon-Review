5.0,It's a water filter that helps remove bad flavors in our refrigerator water system,Our refrigerator came with an in the door water ice option It doesn t dispense ice though it s suppose to but it makes ice gives cold water Our water in our area has a nasty dirt taste to it especially in these drought days really tastes bad We use the SpiroPure SP SA NSF Certified Refrigerator Water Filter Replacement for the filter to clean up the taste A caveat here is that we now also have a stage under sink water purifying system which is also hooked up to the refrigerator s incoming water supply So I m not sure if we even need these or any filters in the refrigerator itself anymore But the wife thinks it works so if she s happy br Since we ve always had a filter in the refrigerator since we bought it well before we got the under sink purifying system it did seem to keep the water cleaner tasting we ve kept them in,B08P53GK9H,B08PL426LQ,AEHAQV6BDIVPRP3HOTRWQ6HV4O6A,1659809771049,1,True,0.5012,0.4441,0.0548

5.0,Exact factory replacement for Whirlpool FSP #106-626662,I have a y o Whirlpool fridge with an FSP icemaker that stopped heating correctly causing hollow ice cubes and eventually it ended up turning the tines into the ice cube partially melted or partially frozen depending on when it was happening and would stop then get frozen in the cube and never turn again without forcing a harvest cycle I also had low water flow from my water line so I screwed the valve at my copper water line in and out a few times leaving it opened completely at the end and that fixed the low water flow at both the water dispenser and the icemaker Must have had some build up at the hole in the copper line Buying the tray heater element was more expensive than this almost complete icemaker My wires went thru the inside wall so I wasn t able to swap out the wire connectors that came with it but thankfully my old set hooked up perfectly The front portion and shutoff bar fit perfectly on this new one For less than we re good as new,B005ARCBGY,B005ARCBGY,AH42AU33PGKBN6CIMKNDBLC6IZDQ,1372215442000,1,True,0.6289,0.3509,0.0201
